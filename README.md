# Intro.jl

An introduction to Julia, Gen.jl, and a few other machine-learning libraries.

## Setting up

- Clone (using `git`) or download (via the "Download ZIP" button under "Code")
  this repository.
- Make sure you have Docker installed locally. (However, if you have Julia
  1.6, then use the `Project.toml` file here.)
- Run the `setup.sh` script by opening a Terminal and running `./setup.sh`.
- Then you should use that same Terminal to run `docker-compose up`.
- Wait a few seconds for JupyterLab to start, then head over to port: `46786`.
